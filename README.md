# XIVDupeFinder

A simple plugin to highlight inventory duplicates that can be stacked.
Much of the inventory work was already completed by [Tischel on their InventorySearchBar plugin.](https://github.com/Tischel/InventorySearchBar/).

Most of the code with minor modiciations inside `XIVDupeFinder\Inventories` is done by @Tischel.
