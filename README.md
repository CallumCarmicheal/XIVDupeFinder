# XIVDupeFinder

A simple plugin to highlight inventory duplicates that can be stacked.
Much of the inventory work was already completed by [Tischel on their InventorySearchBar plugin.](https://github.com/Tischel/InventorySearchBar/).

Most of the code with minor modiciations inside `XIVDupeFinder\Inventories` is done by @Tischel.

Due to the way the code handles highlighting the boxes this may interfere with other plugins such as InventorySearchBar. 
This can be avoided by enabling the ALT modifier setting which will only run the plugin when the alt key is pressed.
